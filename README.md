## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This repository contains fundamental and intermediate-level C programs that helped build my understanding of:
- Basic syntax
- Loops and conditionals
- Functions and recursion
- Arrays and pointers
- File handling
- Data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, etc.)

Whether you're just starting out or revisiting C concepts, this repo is a great reference.
